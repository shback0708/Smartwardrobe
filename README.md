There will be some dependencies on running this code. 

Using flask for backend so setup virtual environment
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

now we should see (env) to the left of the prompt in terminal, indicating now working in a virtual environment

when we want to leave, just run "deactivate"

after running python3 user_interface.py,
go to 127.0.0.1:5000, which is going to be the localhost

when you want to exit out this process, just type command+c to completely kill the process

Hardware -> servo needs to be able to rotate hanger with 35kg

stuff that I need to do today
